% % % % ---------------- PSNR
% 
% 
% The PSNR block computes the peak signal-to-noise ratio, in decibels, between two images.
% This ratio is used as a quality measurement between the original and a compressed image.
% The higher the PSNR, the better the quality of the compressed, or reconstructed image.
% 
% The mean-square error (MSE) and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are used to compare
% image compression quality. The MSE represents the cumulative squared error between the 
% compressed and the original image, whereas PSNR represents a measure of the peak error. 
% The lower the value of MSE, the lower the error.
% 
% To compute the PSNR, the block first calculates the mean-squared error using the following equation:
% 
% MSE=Sigma(  [I1(m,n)?I2(m,n)]2 / M?N
% 
% In the previous equation, M and N are the number of rows and columns in the input images.
% Then the block computes the PSNR using the following equation:
% 
% PSNR=10log10(R2/MSE)
% 
% In the previous equation, R is the maximum fluctuation in the input image data type.
% For example, if the input image has a double-precision floating-point data type, 
%     then R is 1. If it has an 8-bit unsigned integer data type, R is 255, etc.

% % % % ----------------Computing PSNR for Color Images
% 
% Different approaches exist for computing the PSNR of a color image. Because the human eye 
% is most sensitive to luma information, you can compute the PSNR for color images by converting
% the image to a color space that separates the intensity (luma) channel, such as YCbCr. The Y (luma),
% in YCbCr represents a weighted average of R, G, and B. G is given the most weight,
% again because the human eye perceives it most easily. Compute the PSNR only on the luma channel.
